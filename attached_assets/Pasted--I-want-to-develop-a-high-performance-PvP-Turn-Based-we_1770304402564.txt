"I want to develop a high-performance, PvP Turn-Based web game titled 'Encryption War.' The game is a cybersecurity-themed take on the classic Mastermind logic. I need the project to use a modern web stack (React/Next.js or Vite) with a focus on 'Hacker' aesthetics and real-time multiplayer functionality via Firebase.

1. Tech Stack Requirements:
Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript (for type safety) and Tailwind CSS (for styling).

State Management: React Hooks (Context API or Zustand).

Backend/Real-time: Firebase Realtime Database (for instant synchronization between players).

Hosting: Optimized for Vercel or Netlify.

2. Visual Identity (UI/UX) - 'Hacker Terminal x Pencil Art':
Theme: Deep Dark Mode (#0A0A0A).

Typography: Monospace fonts (e.g., 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code') in Neon Green (#00FF00).

Components:

Input Fields: 4 discrete square cells with neon borders. They should auto-focus on the next field after a digit is entered.

The Console (Log): A terminal-style scrollable area. Crucially, new entries must appear at the top. Every entry needs a timestamp: [14:20:05] > ATTEMPT: 5821 | D:1 N:2.

Art Accents: Integrate low-opacity digital pencil sketches (Pencil Art style) of broken locks or circuit skulls in the background corners to give it a unique, handcrafted feel.

3. PvP & Room System (The 'Room Link' Logic):
Lobby Flow: A clean landing page with a 'Create Private Room' button.

Room Generation: When a room is created, generate a 5-character alphanumeric ID (e.g., xK9p2).

URL Invitation: Update the URL to domain.com/?room=xK9p2. Provide a 'Copy Invite Link' button.

Auto-Join: If a user opens a link with a room parameter, they should automatically join that session as 'Player 2'.

Secret Code Phase:

Player 1 sets a 4-digit secret code.

Player 2 waits until the code is set, then begins the guessing phase.

The secret code must be stored securely in Firebase and never exposed to the opponent's client.

4. Core Gameplay Logic:
The Match: Compare the 4-digit guess against the secret code.

Deadly Hits (D): Correct digit in the correct position.

Near Hits (N): Correct digit in the wrong position.

Turn Management: Disable inputs for the player whose turn it isn't. Show a 'Waiting for Opponent...' status.

5. Advanced Features:
SFX: Mechanical keyboard typing sounds for inputs and a 'digital beep' for the attack button.

Animations: Use Framer Motion for smooth screen transitions and a 'Glitch' effect when a system is successfully hacked (Win condition).

Responsive Design: The UI must be perfectly centered and usable on both mobile browsers and desktop."

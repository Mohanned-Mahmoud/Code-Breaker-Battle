## 🎲 Game Modes

### 👤 1V1 BATTLE (Tactical Duels)

* **🟢 NORMAL:** Classic turn-based tactical hacking. Unlimited time per turn. Plan your moves carefully.
* **🔴 BLITZ (30s):** High-pressure warfare. You have exactly 30 seconds per turn. If the timer hits zero, your turn is forcefully skipped!
* **⚡ GLITCH:** Unpredictable rules and chaotic system variables.
* **⚙️ CUSTOM:** Equip up to 4 specific powerups to build your own loadout.

### 👥 PARTY MODE (3-6 Players Chaos)

* **🎯 FREE FOR ALL:** A chaotic race to decrypt opponents. Play to a target score (Points) or until only one hacker remains (Elimination).
* **💀 BATTLE ROYALE:** True survival mode. Once your code is broken, your system is compromised. Last hacker standing wins.
* **💰 BOUNTY CONTRACTS:** The system assigns a high-value target (HVT). Decrypting the hunted target grants massive bonus points (+6 PTS).
